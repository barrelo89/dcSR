# dcSR: Practical Video Quality Enhancement using Data-Centric Super-Resolution
This is the repository that contains all the python and ffmpeg source code for the publication accepted in ACM CONEXT'21. You can access the paper through this link.

## Prerequisities
- Environment: Ubuntu 16.04 or Ubuntu 18.04
- Language: Python (Super Resolution), C (Video Decoding)
- Need to install 'FFMPEG' [link](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) from "source".
1. Download FFMPEG source code (We used ffmpeg-4.2.1, which can be found in this [link](https://ffmpeg.org/releases/))
2. Unzip "ffmpeg-X.X.X.tar" file (henceforth, we use "ffmpeg-4.2.1.tar").
3. Navigate to 'ffmpeg-4.2.1/ffmpeg-4.2.1' and check the file in the path.
```
cd ffmpeg-4.2.1
ls
```
You can see the directory contains the following files.
